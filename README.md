# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

In this repository I was able to develop front-end skills creating responsive templates for the tweets as well as changing the element flow for small and big screens. This project was built using HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX, NodeJs and Express.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository onto your local device.
2. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
3. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
4. Go to <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser.

## Dependencies
- Express
- Node 5.10.x or above

## How to use it
- The user can create a new tweet by typing a interesting text into the textarea, which is limited by 140 characters.
- It will be assigned automatically a username, user ID, cute avatar and timestamp for how long ago it was created.
- You can resize the screen bigger or smaller with a breakpoint of 768px (check the images below).
